Movie Ranker is a React based web app that allows users to search and review movies. Users can also create an account, recover passwords, add a bio,
 view their profile, subscribe to our premium plan, view movie descriptions as see reviews left by other users.

    2.  After that, enter 'npm install'
    3.  Next, run 'npm start'
    4.  After the website compiles, open localhost:3000 in any web browser, and the website should be present
